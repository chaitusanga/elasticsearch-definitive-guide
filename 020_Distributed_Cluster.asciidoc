[[distributed-cluster]]
== Life inside a Cluster

.Supplemental Chapter
****

As mentioned earlier, this is the first of several ``supplemental'' chapters
about how Elasticsearch operates in a distributed environment.  In this
chapter we explain commonly used terminology like _cluster_, _node_ and
_shard_, the mechanics of how Elasticsearch scales out, and how it deals with
hardware failure.

Although this chapter is not required reading -- you can use Elasticsearch for
a long time without worrying about shards, replication and failover -- it will
help you to understand the processes at work inside Elasticsearch. Feel free
to skim through the chapter and to refer to it again later.
